Got no compassion for rats
The pastor said, Who else gon bleed for me?
I told all my side bitches they couldnt cheat on me, uh
Natural disasters, all these emotional rappers
Master of my own fate and I own my own masters

Demons tryna have an auction in me
They wanna sell my soul
Goin once, goin twice, never sold
Best story that was never told

Balance, eye contact, elbow room, follow through
See, thats what I was taught to do
I probably learned more from Coach Gwynn
Than I did from my own kin
Yeah, the streets was my sensei
I sold dope then rapped about it on my mixtape
I had respect but I gained more

Getting high and committing crimes, let a nigga live
Ive been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick

Uh, now when the ones that didnt see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put em in a fucking hearse or two
Im the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Keshas name
In Jesuss name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When its time to eat, when its time to lay
And when its daytime it aint my time of day, uh
I heard my little big cousin mad at me

I love and helped raise my nigga

A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod

Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull, matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks feenin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out
Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch
Death to a snitch, get it while you can break and shit
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a Glad bag
You know I’m gettin’ mines, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed the pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you could put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview, one of your headlights out nigga

She said she tired of the generic

I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”
And, if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element, ugh

He said, One more chance, he said, One more chance
He said, One more chance, you wont regret it 
He say, One more chance, he said, One more chance

They say taxes gonna pay for the plan

Kinda hard for a nigga tryna stack
What are taxes, for real, though?
We livin that high life
Dont let em try to Wesley you
You get rich, they gon try to Wesley you
What bracket that you in, yeah, all of that depends
See the taxes pay the government to build a new bridge
See they take from the rich, give to the poor and sick
And I cant lie, I been on both sides of the fence
See, the education levels round here dont exist
Taxes pay 12 but dont pay em to kill the kids
What it is? That was just a cellphone in his hand
I think Sam takin grams out the bag
Uncle Sam takin grams out the bag
I think Sam takin grams out the bag
Uncle Sam takin grams out the bag
Kinda hard for a nigga tryna stack

Too Short with the hoes on, old school had vogues on em
Told shorty better hold on, then clicked over said hold on
Then, I hung up on both of em, then put my clothes on
Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego

And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeno

Hottest nigga in the city, where them bitches at
Where them bitches at
We ain’t even seen em
Where them bitches at 
We ain’t even seen em
All I All I know
Girls start choosing I’m like alright alright ho
Do it all night long, and we ended on the couch but we started on the phone
Now we stay together, what we started at our home and
When I say it’s on then it’s on like a bitch
And I put it on her ass and it’s been on ever since
And I own own rent, and I own my own shit
I got a bottle of cologne that costs more than your rent
And I came from cement, we the hardest of the hardest
And by now you noticed we the hottest of the hottest
And I’m probably in my Pradas, or flexing in my Fendis
When we shoot it, we shoot it till it’s empty
Where them bitches at? 
There them bitches go 
Tell them bitches no 
Why? cause they move too slow 
I’m looking, I seen em
I like em, I eat em
I’m swerving in my BM, shoutsout to my BM
Gucci on my denim, Gucci on my womens
She fit that so splendid, articulate she winning
Yeah my trap going ham and my money expanding
We were dope boys and now we dope man
Checkerboard luggage
Raymond in the cupboard
You listening to the lyrical nunchuck
Chuckling dumbfucks
Vocals warmed up, beyond Ford tough
I kept my lawn cut
I got my arm out the window of an armed truck
On Cleveland Avenue made plays at the Kroger
Came up on cold cuts
Heart got a hole in it
Bank got a roll in it
They coming in so big I need a stove in it
Now thats deep I just dove in it
The closet came with garage doors
The Goyard is on all fours
I do this shit for encores
I did this shit in Tom Ford
They said Im on four
Im so fly I looked up and said get on boy
Its the man, its the myth, in the midst of the minks
With the Ms on my mind in Maui taking pics
Motivated by more that mean
I want more of this, I want more jewelry
More cars I want more cribs
What you expect from a kid
That grew up with his stomach touching his rib
Echos coming from out the fridge
My papa was a rolling stone I thought you knew that
Dont smoke no cig but Ill shoot at true facts
From the Jets to the jet
From the nigga in the cut
To the one cutting cheques
So who’s the one cutting cheques
You know acid reflux
I had to throw that shit up and then
Straight out the alley way
Flipped the long cheque and ran off on Sallie Mae
Paddy cake, paddy cake
I’m from where you either own dust or got allergies
Playin’ polo, white tee, ho beater under that
With some hoes up under me
And the watch cost a quarter, keep
My music on and I’m a beast, these shoes on that arent released
But soon as I got back, I pull right up in five flat
And he was not that
Might peel your top back
Pop that, you don’t need a car to get carjacked
Dump the ashes at the red light
Just left the barbecue, me and two red dykes
And you knowing what they saying, right?
What’s that?
That nigga luckier than a motherfucker
I gotta get away
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course, nigga
Back yard full of golf balls
Grandma crib use to smell like moth balls
I used to pray that they would pop off
Hand tossed in, drop off at the drop off
Programmed to be great
In a Caddy Brougham with my name on the seats
I used to pray till I was sleep
When it was cold I used to have to use my coat for a sheet
The oven for the heat
The dude that used to work on the plum and used to geek
Your whole style is obsolete
They say that money talk thats why you niggas never speak
And I aint worried bout nothing
Fuck around and give life for the aggravated flicks
Cyber dust if you are textin’
Theyll take that shit to trial
And I done killed it in Giuseppe
I thank God for the blessin’
Then I look in the mirror, thank God for the freshness
And I came up from nothin’
It ain’t nothin’ but a comma
Me and my niggas bout to fuck the city up
I dropped twenty bands early just to get the Bentley truck
We walked in the Blue Flame, there was like ten of us
They were calling my name, they were like, Tity Boi
We were trying to lay low like we had some tint on us
And me and Cap 1 looked like we got ten on us
We dont have to rent no bus, we dont have to rent no tux
I know things was slowing down, but now things are picking up
You aint whip a brick enough, your old girl aint thick enough
And if you aint got a mill in cash, you aint rich enough
All these niggas switching up, all these niggas bitching up
Even if they was drowning, they know not to reach at us
Trying to make a speaker bust, riding in a diesel truck
Teachers tried to preach at us, but they wasnt deep enough
Only thing you had for dinner was a blunt and Pizza Hut
Only thing you had for dessert was a fucking Reeses cup
See, Im the Dean of The Real U
My girl working at the spot said she dont feel you
I wanna fuck her and I want her, too
I need pussy rehab, nigga, what about you?
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
This is part two and I cant go no further

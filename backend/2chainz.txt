My fashion sense commenced when I was young
Wore guns in dungarees next to a pack of gum
Unfit mothers that's on that butter, concrete gutter
Wanna hear that gun talk, that Draco stutter

They threw me out to the wolves, the wolves threw me back
Got no compassion for rats
The pastor said, "Who else gon' bleed for me?"
I told all my side bitches they couldn't cheat on me, uh
Natural disasters, all these emotional rappers
Master of my own fate and I own my own masters

I had respect but I gained more
You rather be underrated or unemployed?
Hmm, think on it
Keisha ring big enough to skate on it
My lifestyle big enough to hate on
This beat hard enough to put Jay on
My yard too big to put a rake on it

When I look down, all I see is some sucka shit
And I'ma run shit, I put that on my bucket list
Adidas streetball, all the foreigns with the straps
Before the dreadlocks, I had the cornrows to the back
Used to sit on a broke down Camaro with packs
Told her, "Turn around," even though she had his name tatted
That's the way that it was, had a way with the girls
Had a felony before you knew what a felony was
You was taking the shots, you was feeling the buzz

Look at my ice, I'm so nice, it's like Mardi Gras
Mama I shot me a man, please go hide the gun
When she ask me my number, I say I'm the one
Rushing summer to summer until someone come
Wake up in the morning, roll a blunt and then I count bank
Pull out the garage, hit a button then the top faint
You ain't from the "A", all you really did was migrate
Asking me if I'm great, yeah bitch I'm great
Swerving down Peachtree, yeah bitch I'm straight
Every day my birthday, yeah bitch I get cake

We used to wear the mask like Friday the 1-3
Then I found out I had that pimp in my bloodstream
Got me one ho and then I got me a whole team

If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Drugs backed in 'em mean them things in
Now it's duffle bags full of green men
I swear I ain't lying if my daddy hadn't died
He’d tell ya I had em' hooked like Kareem did
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino, different kind of pinot
Tried to stack c-note after c-note
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw at the free throw
Line, it's a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes, let a nigga live
I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick
I remember when I believed in me
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, now when the ones that didn't see me
They want a verse or two
Shit, what am I supposed to do?
Put 'em in a fucking hearse or two
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
Well at least until the pizza came
Or at least until polices came
Undercovers outside my momma yard
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
In Jesus's name I pray
I say that a couple times a day
When it's time to eat, when it's time to lay
And when it's daytime it ain't my time of day, uh
I heard my little big cousin mad at me
I call him little big cause he younger than me
But he big, he was the high school team captain
Didn't graduate but sometimes things happen
And whatever happen that was the worst day
And who know what was going on in the first place
I love and helped raise my nigga
This year forgot to call him on his birthday
It's hard to explain my new lifestyle
A partner lockdown, got a phone and an iPod
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
We had similar stars, but I ain't figured his part
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture
Pull up in your city askin' bout my back-then
I pull it out your girl tell me put it back in
Hair weave killer have me puttin' tracks in

Audemar P, tell 'em order more drinks
It be me, her and her tell 'em all the more freaks
I'm gettin' to the Benjis I be puttin' it in her kidney
Addicted to the money smokin' loud from my prescription
Look at my position man I started off local
Now I got my own shows and I don't need a fuckin' co-host
I'm a logo ho I got logos all over me
Photos of me posin' like Jodeci, poetry
Me and two girls man you know it's like floetry
I tell 'em hoes goodnight go to sleep
Forty deep forty day forty nights
Sippin' dirty sprite
Married to the game that's my prototype
My polo white my four door white white rims
Lookin' like Casper
I'm the man bitch you can be the man after
I provide jobs like a contractor
One button make the car back up
See I'm a syrup sippin' animal, emcee cannibal
All I spit is gasoline, all my verses flammable 
I be going -- I be going hard
I'm from GA just to state the odds
PSA -- public service announcement
If you ain't gettin' no money get the hell from 'round me
You don't grind you don't eat check the logo
Duffel bag full of cash I'm hard like a porno
My sweater come from Polo
Sweat her that's a no-no
And no I'm not from D.C. but bitch you gotta go-go

Pause -- smoke fo', pause -- smoke mo' I need to take a photo
Cam-er-a ready when I walk out the front do'
Last name respect first name utmost
Mama don’t work, heater don’t work
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks feenin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out
Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch
Death to a snitch, get it while you can break and shit
Its 3:30 in the A.M
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a Glad bag
You know I’m gettin’ mines, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed the pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you could put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview, one of your headlights out nigga
I just got my first R&B bitch and got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?
I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”
And, if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element, ugh
He say, "One more chance," he say, "One more chance"
He say, "One more chance, you won't forget it"
He said, "One more chance," he said, "One more chance"
He said, "One more chance, you won't regret it" 
He say, "One more chance," he said, "One more chance"
He said, "One more chance," like he Biggie 
Say it one more time, I don't stand in line
Got my drive in overdrive
I work overtime and he take half of mine

They say taxes gonna pay for the plan
I think Sam takin' grams out the bag
Uncle Sam takin' grams out the bag

What are taxes, for real, though?
We livin' that high life
Don't let 'em try to Wesley you
You get rich, they gon' try to Wesley you
What bracket that you in, yeah, all of that depends
See the taxes pay the government to build a new bridge
See they take from the rich, give to the poor and sick
And I can't lie, I been on both sides of the fence
See, the education levels 'round here don't exist
Taxes pay 12 but don't pay 'em to kill the kids
What it is? That was just a cellphone in his hand
I think Sam takin' grams out the bag
Uncle Sam takin' grams out the bag
I think Sam takin' grams out the bag
Uncle Sam takin' grams out the bag
Kinda hard for a nigga tryna stack

Where you from? Where you rode the bus? 
Yeah, them Migos from the North 
And I'm like the Snowman when I'm holdin' on a fork 
And I'm like Dro when I'm rockin' Polo Sport
I feel like Gucci when I'm walkin' out of court
Rest in peace Lo, rest in peace Bankroll
One time for Rocko, Tip, and Roscoe
One of the top flows, on the top floor
Get it wholesale like Costco
You know I got that glow, Bruce LeRoy
As far as the rappers, I'm startin' to eat more
Lamborghini truck, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck, Lambo, Lamborghini truck
Lamborghini truck 
Nigga, I remember when Baby D was in BMF

Atlanta shit

Nigga, the whole Atlanta gonna have a Lambo truck, nigga
You know how we do, gettin' a bag down here, nigga
Lamborghini truck 
Doin' such a good job, I pat myself on the back
Flight confirmation, I cash through the app
Ain't nobody robbin' me, I answer doors with a strap
Anywhere I go, I put Southside on the map
Shawty said she love me, I said, "I love me back" 
Try to cuss me out, I ain't goin' for that 
A nigga said he want my plugs so they can order the packs
But I'm addicted to the trap, you never know I relapse so
I can't go for that, no, no 
No can do, nigga
I can't go for that, no, no
No can do, oh
I can't go for that, no, no
No can do
I can't go for that, can't go for that 
I can't go for that, I can't go for that 
I call your phone, you ain't answer yours
I ain't goin' for the bull like a matador 
Text me, if I don't reply quick, you trip 
I'm Jefe, I'm the highest on the list 
Kick it like Judo, the numero uno, yes I'm the highness
My house so far back in the woods that can't nobody find us
A driveway so long that you can run out of gas
Keep askin' me for money, you need to get off your ass
I beat a charge then I bounce back 
Drop 125 and brought a ounce back 
Got the Cognac color on the inside 
And the Forgiatos covered with the big tires 
When your friend come make sure she keep quiet 
Or the next time I see her I'll be senile 
Look around like this must be a mixup 
I can't fuck with you if you gonna switch up 
So many watches, I need a time capsule
Combine all my thoughts, make my mind travel
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
In my muscle car, maybe we should arm wrestle
I'm raw, using all caps, I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around it
Yellow tape, never hesitate
2 Chainz derived from Section 8
Meditate, that's my stress relief
I've been stylin' on 'em since a lease, preach
My pop told me men don't cry
Then he turned around and died on me
So I didn't know what else to do
But motherfuckin' cry, homie
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
And me, I got more to see, more to be
Order three, started with a quarter ki'
I'm so ill I need penicill'
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days, you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till
I treat Goat like he was tata, dealin' up at Popeyes
In the fastlane, I move him over to the right side
Mac-11 life style, burrrt then I hop out
Dem burrrt, then it's lights out, I'm spazin' on you right now
Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare
Being front to god, grey hair, see that's that old money
Kenmore stove money, packs on G rouge money
Ridin' down in that foreign whip the color of snow bunny
Pull up right to the beach and left the boat runnin'
So Sonny, you a comedian, all your flows funny
Dope funny, walk through the door, she like "Oh honey"
Plus I got a whip and a lock, they call me 4hunna
Tryna come clean off the spot, I'm talkin' detergent
Fuck her then answer my phone, I gotta leave urgent
Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual
Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth
Show you what the extra do
Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe
One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it
Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable, fuck her on the sectional
Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles
Sixteen carefully, swag sold separately
Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony
Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me
I ain't never been a minute man
Pour a deuce in a minute maid
Trap house filled with ceilling fans
Weed louder than a hearing aid
Bitch same color lemonade
We don't got to rent a renegade
And I tip my barber a hunnid
The only thing I might get is temple fades
Tryna take another nigga's story
You a fuck nigga and I know it
See I could wear black in the summertime
And I could wear white when its snowin'
I could show you where to go like a local
Order 20 bags out of Oakland
I might buy me a motorcycle
And use your girl for a chauffeur
I'm the realest nigga and the illest nigga
Fuck you lil nigga and your lil sister
Try to use a nigga when it's beneficial
Free all my niggas out the penitentiary
Louis V all on my luggage
Bitch better get on my level
Put a half a milli in a MCM bag
Had that motherfucker looking pregnant

At the same time make her do the dishes
Oh oh oh double middle finger to the picture
Handgun got a nose like Pippen
Girls come through they want to smoke
'Fore they leave this bitch they start strippin'
900 dollars for the tennis shoes
Get a lap dance in the living room
Treat the bathtub like a jacuzzi
Cause the trap house don't got a swimming pool
Money piled up on the counter
Got a hundred round drum in the other counter
Got Ziploc bags and a digital scale and rubber bands all by the money counter

Gold rose petals
Out of the alphabet
G is my favorite letter

I drunk so much pussy last night I got a hangover
It ain't no sleep until I impregnate my vault
Swagging like I could play back-court for the Hawks
I don't even think weed strong unless that I cough
In my mama's house so big she went downstairs and got lost
Secret society, all we got is us
I know I'm blessed cause I don't believe in luck
Looked in the mirror like, "You the only one that I trust"
And she ain't even that cute, so I only look at her butt
King Tut with a robe on, Slick Rick with the gold on
Too Short with the hoes on, old school had vogues on em'
Told shorty better hold on, then clicked over said hold on
Then, I hung up on both of em', then put my clothes on
Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talking 'bout you popped the molly? You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeno
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
I can make her ass wiggle, I can get some cash with her
Talking 'bout your ex-boyfriend, fuck you and your last nigga
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking 'bout us

We stole our cable from next door
It was still a finesse though
I'm still here, where the rest go?
This right here manifesto

And my hair grow like it's kudzu
Told her take a hike like hut two

Geeked up for a hundred nights

Gave me the key to the city
And zapped me back kinda quickly
Mama on stage, sippin' champagne

Party turned up but it just begun
Expenses paid!

Shawty gave me that head , yeah, she got that snapback 
And you know her ass fat and you know I cash eyed
All this ice on me, I'm killin' 'em by a landslide 
And you know I can't dive, I'm so fly, I rather hand glide
In first class, with my Rollie on, airtime, airtime, airtime
Okay I see the agenda that they are trying to push
Dear America, why you ain't tell me who's legalizing kush?
If I had known that earlier, I did it by the books
But instead I had skip to class and go and make a jugg
College grad might I add, let me retract
I'm a gift that's already open, let me re-wrap
Had it up here with the money, talking knee-cap
It's a thin line between cuz's house and the D-fax
Asked them folks to give me a chance
I'm just a juvenile, got so high
I told my attorney that I'm a sewer cloud
Catching me back out of the space, I can move the crowd
If somebody die over here, then they was moving out
Always get portrayed as a villain, oh what a feeling
Ran this shit up off of adrenaline and got a million
Then got another mill, can't forget the other deal
Yeah I got plenty more, bitch I'm talking twenty more
I do a show in a Fendi store
You know I'm great I'm talking 8, I'm talking 24
I'm talking pool, I'm talking lake, I'm talking tennis court
I'm 6'5" it's hard to ride an Aventador 
God keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right
God keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right
God keep on blessin' me, I'm doin' somethin' right
My neighbor that stay next to me wanna go to war at night
Somebody broke into his spot, he thought it was my guys
He tried to call us a gang, 'cause we were organized
Shawty fire, she the flame, pretty brown eyes
Somethin' wrong, I had missed calls, 55 times
When they told me Johnny died, I couldn't believe that shit
My whole studio off the net, I had to leave that shit
They said "Cuz, send him through", so Big must've knew
See where I'm from, your heart will turn into an igloo
See they resent you, simply because they ain't you
Didn't even have can openers for canned food
Anger issues, goin' cashews
Sellin' packs and ashews so hence the attitude
Goin' animal, gettin' treated like one
Over 21, black and livin', you an icon
Pay for a funeral, find out he snitched, want a refund
If you get robbed more than once, that's a rerun
Shoot out at East Point, Escobar and eat lunch
You know what kind of home I came from, I got free lunch
Free Baby and I'm sorry I ain't kept in touch
There's so many people I take care of every month, Lord
I'm in that black on black, black on black crime zone
Please don't let them take your life about them rhinestones
I'm from where you sell a brick, that's a milestone
If you got some good dope, the line's a mile long
Gotta be in ya, not on ya like a chromosome
My best friend when I was trappin' was the mobile phone
 Hello, Hello, where you at?
I need more, then say less, uh
The mink I got, pet detective mad 'bout this shit
Gotta brag 'bout this shit
'Cause me and mama had a sofa that we had to split
Before I left, I heard Banks say, "Pass the stick"
Now if we talkin' magazines, It's a lot of issues
But if you see it in black and white, it is so official
And the bro sent me a gift, along with a scripture
It said, "When you shoot your shot, make sure you're the pistol" 
Breath of fresh air from the bando to Buckhead
You was so far ahead, did I catch up? I mustered
That saucy, not Ross but bossy 
Put her legs in the air, nine months after, that car seat 
Hand on her body , lower back, arch it 
Crib in LA, I go next door to party 
Real ones, no weaklings, concerned 'bout minglings
Got a question for you, how you thick and you petite? 
Beat it up, a lil' skeet, skeet, from the Southside, a lil' Kiki 
If she got that good head, might put that throat on repeat 
Make her make the bed up just to fuck, I'm a neat freak 
And I'm from Atlanta, got a bloodline full of Freaknik 
I'm right there where the looters are or somewhere at a hookah bar
Flew to London just to shop, I told 'em, "I'll be back tomorrow" 
In the back like ad-libs, silk on my mattress 
Condo in Jupiter, do you want my address? 
I'm thinking about moving to Mexico
Got my raw paper filled with Texaco
All I ever wanted was some better dope
Pull up on a nigga with the packs
Give a nigga this and serve a nigga with a strap
Told em when it come to the commas, think a nigga momma put her in a Honda, drive her straight down the ramp
Yeah I need a stamp, cuz a nigga might send it
You know I need racks, cuz a nigga might spend it
I could buy a back, when I pad that
I could take a brick and turn that shit to a Bentley
I could take a village and turn it to a mansion
I'm about dinero and I'm rockin' a sombrero
All I scream is church, like a nigga tryna pastor
Damn boy looking like a computer
All I talk is chicken, like I'm wooping it at Hoodas
29 grams if it come with the plastic
Got a brick the same color Alaska
I can go slow then I can go faster
I might move away, cuz these hoes harassing
If she a freak Imma find out, I don't know but Imma find out
And she ain't got no class, had to put that bitch on time out
I just fucked her in the living room, pussy so deep I had to climb out
And she never seen my bedroom, she ain't ever seen my momma house
Check a hoe, then I check my bank account
I'm sipping codeine with my pinky out
And I don't talk about bitches man, unless the head good enough to think about it
So hold on let me think about it
Wait a 1 minute, let me think about it
Shawty pussy so wet mane, I mean a bitch need a sink around it
Just bought a new crib, need a new one
Got an old school red and a blue one
Me and my niggas got fur coats on, make it look like the fucking zoo coming
Told my old bitch I need a new one
Sold my last brick, I need a new one
She always talking about working out, so I stretched her out like a futon
Fuck my last bitch on a coffee table 
Fuck my new bitch on a hockey table
If you don't know, you better find out
Bat cave, honeycomb hide out
I slip in and I slide out
I'm known to go deep, like a white out
Paid $100 for some head, nigga, Say you ain't did it!
I know a lick at 4 mil', nigga, Say you ain't with it!
Now if we hit this lick, nigga, & you don't want to split it
Then it's bow, bow, bow to your motherfuckin' fitted, now!

And yeah I'm on my own, I'm screamin' "Fuck it"
Fuck it, I'm whippin' it crazy
I'm ridin' the foreign, I'm doin' 180
My chain so heavy, my brain so deadly
Type of nigga buy the watch & change the bezzy
They ain't never seen me comin' like this
Smokin' on that gasoline in the VIP
They need ding-a-ling for the trampoline
Cause all these bitches want to do is jump on the dick
I hop over fence, I'm offended by co-defendants
Drink codeine for mornin' sickness
Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness
Allstate, accident forgiveness
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different
This that Me Time at the finest
You won't beat me or see me whinin'
I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side
I like thighs & breasts, I hide from stress
I don't even know where my phone at
Crib so motherfuckin big, I don't even know where my room at!
Whip so fast they say ''there he go''

My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo
Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas
I'm still the king of my city and they know it
And I paint pictures with these words, I'm a poet
And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin'
A 50 a check then I'm in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted
In my Lo Bootz

Righteous prices, baking soda vices

Somebody pass the croissants
Somebody pass me a lighter
Somebody pass me a joint
I’m using my rap for intimidation
Using my gat for a demonstration
If my car ever got impounded
It would be locked up for illegal immigration
That’s a small thing to a Godzilla
Got me more bars than a bartender
I met a car dealer, my car came with wine
And yours came with some malt liquor
Swipping and swapping the pack suit
I wish I had me some ack

I'm goin' thru it, dawg. I'm goin' thru it

Come off the top, comin' from my heart

Niggas know my flow, straight out the pot
And the work, straight off the dock
Cross the wrong path, you'll be straight at the doc
Keisha started crying, "Mama pray for me"
If my nigga cross me, he a dead homie!
Erase him, cremate him, we made him, replace him
Replay it like a murder scene
And I pause it
On the part where you mothafuckas bleed

Run in the bank like Jason in the mothafucka, masked up!

Feet up, and my iron cocked
Nigga not grown, they gon' get they mind rocked
Runnin' shit like a Z28 IROC
From the apartments, dinner I had sack lunch

To the one cutting cheques
So who’s the one cutting cheques
You know acid reflux
I had to throw that shit up and then
Straight out the alley way
Flipped the long cheque and ran off on Sallie Mae
Paddy cake, paddy cake
I’m from where you either own dust or got allergies
Playin’ polo, white tee, ho beater under that
With some hoes up under me
And the watch cost a quarter, keep
My music on and I’m a beast, these shoes on that aren't released
But soon as I got back, I pull right up in five flat
And he was not that
Might peel your top back
Pop that, you don’t need a car to get carjacked
Dump the ashes at the red light
Just left the barbecue, me and two red dykes
And you knowing what they saying, right?
What’s that?
That nigga luckier than a motherfucker
I gotta get away
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course
Fuck that, never let nobody take me out my zone
You try me or something?
With no remorse, four door Porsche
New crib by the golf course, nigga
Back yard full of golf balls
Grandma crib use to smell like moth balls
I used to pray that they would pop off
Hand tossed in, drop off at the drop off
Programmed to be great
In a Caddy Brougham with my name on the seats
I used to pray till I was sleep
When it was cold I used to have to use my coat for a sheet
The oven for the heat
The dude that used to work on the plum and used to geek
Your whole style is obsolete
They say that money talk that's why you niggas never speak
And I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Fuck around and give life for the aggravated flicks
Cyber dust if you are textin’
They'll take that shit to trial
And I done killed it in Giuseppe
I thank God for the blessin’
Then I look in the mirror, thank God for the freshness
And I came up from nothin’
It ain’t nothin’ but a comma
Me and my niggas 'bout to fuck the city up
I dropped twenty bands early just to get the Bentley truck
We walked in the Blue Flame, there was like ten of us
They were calling my name, they were like, "Tity Boi"
We were trying to lay low like we had some tint on us
And me and Cap 1 looked like we got ten on us
We don't have to rent no bus, we don't have to rent no tux
I know things was slowing down, but now things are picking up
You ain't whip a brick enough, your old girl ain't thick enough
And if you ain't got a mill in cash, you ain't rich enough
All these niggas switching up, all these niggas bitching up
Even if they was drowning, they know not to reach at us
Trying to make a speaker bust, riding in a diesel truck
Teachers tried to preach at us, but they wasn't deep enough
Only thing you had for dinner was a blunt and Pizza Hut
Only thing you had for dessert was a fucking Reese's cup
See, I'm the Dean of The Real U
My girl working at the spot said she don't feel you
I wanna fuck her and I want her, too
I need pussy rehab, nigga, what about you?
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
This is part two and I can't go no further
Until Gucci come home and put a verse up on this motherfucker
Got a 35 in my roll paper
Spice One riding east bay gangster

I'm on a money makin' mission
And I'm icy, snow cone, and she like me, who don’t
Im infatuated with money and the hoes
This is not a boxer this a four door, car so cold man you need to wear a fur coat
Four zips pole got me walking round slow-mo
Everyone saying you should have went solo
But they dont really no though
This is how we do it
Steal from the rich bring back it to the hood

Tell shawty buss it open off on a new song
Got a present for the present in a gift wrapping

Louie V is my kyrptonite
Take ya bitch and I give her back

Fine wine and lobster tail
Candlelight and Chrisette Michele
Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill
Pockets on fat burger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed the Viagra with the Soda
Staying focused
Black and white ice, polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
I pull her close and I put it there
Started off with a OZ
End up riding fo' deep
Pull up to that club like
Mothafucka ho you don't know me
They turn the lights down, and open the curtains
All the fans stand up and they start roaring
Go Tity Boi, go go Tity Boi
Go Tity Boi, go go Tity Boi
You ain’t got no money take your broke ass home
I’m on the cocaine zone, four cellphones
We make the chicken fight, like Roy Jones
The roof know magic, poof, be gone
New suit own with the valet with the duffel
If you see me pumping gas, take a picture, it’s a poster
Living la vida loca
Reloader, clip like a soldier, clique full of soldiers
Front line, untie you, put my Pradas on your sofa
I’m supposed to pose, all my clothes is vocal
Loud ass jacket, stupid belt buckles
Brand new pair of boots, I spent two Gs on em
And the boots got two Gs on em
I crunk your bitch up I had no cheese on me
Cause I crumpled my cup up with no keys on me
It’s big money over here nigga
Got the Tommy gun and the Tommy Hilfiger
Tell that bitch to come holler at a real nigga
When she see a nigga, I got so much swag it’s OD a nigga
It’s dripping all over my motherfucking pinion nigga
But this a process, the thought process
I dress like I’m in a motherfucking contest
Paid $100 for some head, nigga, Say you ain't did it!
I know a lick at 4 mil', nigga, Say you ain't with it!
Now if we hit this lick, nigga, & you don't want to split it
Then it's bow, bow, bow to your motherfuckin' fitted, now!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck!

And yeah I'm on my own, I'm screamin' "Fuck it"
Fuck it, I'm whippin' it crazy

My chain so heavy, my brain so deadly
Type of nigga buy the watch & change the bezzy
They ain't never seen me comin' like this
Smokin' on that gasoline in the VIP
They need ding-a-ling for the trampoline
Cause all these bitches want to do is jump on the dick
I hop over fence, I'm offended by co-defendants
Drink codeine for mornin' sickness
Your dad was a motherfuckin' snitch, so nigga, you were born a witness
Allstate, accident forgiveness
Say my name by accident, We actin' ignorant
Doing a drive-by while you playin' different
This that Me Time at the finest
You won't beat me or see me whinin'
I am gangsta like the Raiders cap with a Jheri Curl on the side
I like thighs & breasts, I hide from stress

You niggas pussy, fucking rat on your homies

Got on my chains, I'm lookin like a dope boy
These niggas don't want it, I put that on mañana
My chain into 100, my belt Ferragamo
Go to LA, meet the plug at Katanas
I'm still the king of my city and they know it
And I paint pictures with these words, I'm a poet
And I drop the top on my whip, and we soarin'
A 50 a check then I'm in it, if niggas stay with it then they get extorted
Whip so fast they say there he go
Bitch so bad, man, I think she know
Turned 100 to a mill, man I think they know
Ducking on the low, man, I think they know
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin’ syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don’t let ‘em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin’ for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
